Wildfire conditions are becoming more extreme and increasingly reflect rising global temperatures.

As the planet continues to rapidly warm, wildfires will become a growing problem. Consequently, the fires are not just local problems; they pose international challenges..

The main goal of this project is to provide help to our Government especially General Directorate of Civil Defense in Rapid detection of forest fire to reduce casualties and property losses and Doing a fire warning alert if the live camera see the fire.
